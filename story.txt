The porsche drove his BMW.
He was very uncomfortable because his lederhose was riding up.
But he wouldn't let anything slow him down on his way to his favorite Ratskeller.
He didn't have to worry about the lederhose ride because his klimaanlage kept everything breezy.
At the ratskeller they have a bierfarten in the back that is full of crazy porsches and gebaeck
He enjoyed his time at the ratskeller, but he had to leave early to go to the Flughafen.
